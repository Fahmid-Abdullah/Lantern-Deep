# 🕯️ Lantern Deep

Lantern Deep is a **top-down 2D stealth adventure** built in Unity, blending tight movement, reactive abilities, and moody atmosphere with an intimate, narrative-driven experience. Navigate dimly lit environments, avoid lurking dangers, and uncover story moments hidden between silence and shadow.
You are not meant to rush. You are meant to notice.

## 🌒 Premise
You descend into a quiet, enclosed world where every step matters. Armed with only a lantern and a handful of abilities, you must navigate hostile spaces, interact with strange NPCs, and survive long enough to piece together what lies beneath the surface.

Your task is simple: move forward, survive, and listen.

## 🕳️ World & Atmosphere

Lantern Deep takes place across a series of compact, hand-crafted levels featuring:

- 🕯️ Dimly lit environments where visibility is limited  
- 👤 NPC encounters that hint at a larger story  
- ⚠️ Environmental hazards that punish careless movement  
- 🌫️ A restrained, hand-drawn pixel-art style  
- 💬 Dialogue presented through a typing system with character portraits  

Each space is designed to feel enclosed, intentional, and uneasy.
